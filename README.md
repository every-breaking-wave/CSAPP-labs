# CSAPP-labs

The files in this document are the solutions to the experiments that accompany the CSAPP book, as well as the coursework for the SJTU Class of 2020 ICS in Software Engineering among them.

lab1-lab5, lab7, lab8 are full marks.
lab6 part A&B are full marks, while part C is 54/60 approximately.
lab 9 gets 55/65, failed one test case.
lab 10 gets 43/100 for througput and space util, which is close to the version in Book.

~~I will try again to refine these labs and optimize the code to improve their scores in summer vacation of 2022.~~
